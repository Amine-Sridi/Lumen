I've successfully transformed your Lumen Inventory app from a button-based navigation system to a professional drawer/sidebar navigation structure, similar to the reference app you provided. The app now features a modern, user-friendly navigation experience.

- Beautiful sidebar with app branding
- Organized navigation menu with icons
- User account section
- Logout functionality
- Modern visual design with proper spacing and colors

### 3. **Updated AppNavigator (`app/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`)**

### 4. **Screen Updates**
Updated all main screens to use the new HeaderView component:
